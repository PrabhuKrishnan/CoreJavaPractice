	Java collection framework is a collection of interfaces and classes 
	which helps in sorting and processing the data efficiently
	
	This framework has several useful classes which have tons of useful functions which makes a programmer task easy
	
		  
	Java Collections
	
   1. List
        - A list is an ordered collection(sometimes called a sequence)
        - Lists may contain duplicate elements
      
     Classes that Implement the List Interface 
       
        - ArrayList 
        - LinkedList
        - Vector
        
   2. Set 
   
       - A set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements 
       - However it makes no guarantees concerning the order of iteration 
     
     Classes that implement the set interface 
     
       - HashSet 
       - LinkedHashSet
       - TreeSet
       
     3. Map
     
        - A maps is an object that maps keys to values 
        - A map cannot contain duplicate duplicate keys 
        
      Classes that implement the Map Interface 
      
      - HashMap
      - TreeMap
      - LinkedHashMap
      
      - Read about HashMap  Vs HashTable
