	/*
	  -Abstraction in java means - Hiding the implementation details to the user 
	  -Abstraction can be achieved by using Interface and Abstract Class
	  
	  Example: Sending SMS - the can user can able to send SMS but SMS implementation is hidden 
	  
	  Interface in Java
	  
	  - No Method definition 
	  - Only Method declaration
	  - Can not able to create objects for interface
	  - No Static Methods 
	  - But interface variables are static in nature by default  
	  - Interface, 100% Abstraction 
	  
	  Abstract Class in Java
	  
	  - Abstraction can be achieved by using Abstract using Abstract Class
	  - it have abstract method and Non abstract method 
	  - Can not able to create objects for  Abstract class
	  - can create constructor for Abstract class
	  - can also have final method, then cannot override the method
	  
	  -Why Abstract class is not 100% Abstract,
	  -because the abstract class have abstract method and non-abstract method --> because of that 100% abstraction is not possible
	  -But in interface, it have only abstract method, so 100% abstraction is possible
