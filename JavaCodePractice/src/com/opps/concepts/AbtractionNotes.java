	 In java, Abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes 
	 
	  -An abstract class is a class that is declared with abstract keyword.
	  -An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation
	  -An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods
	  -method defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass, thus making overriding compulsory OR either make subclass itself abstract
	  -Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with abstract keyword.
	  -There can be no object of an abstract class.That is, an abstract class can not be directly instantiated with the new operator
	  -An abstract class can have parameterized constructors and default constructor is always present in an abstract class
